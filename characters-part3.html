      <h3>Kathy</h3>
    <p>In the previous articles, Kathy was gradually revealed as a caring but emotionally guarded character. However, by the third part, she undergoes a significant transformation. She shows resilience and thoughtfulness, especially when caring for Tommy and Ruth's donations. She not only takes care of them with her mind, but she also shows a strong determination - she also tries to change her fate whenever she finds a possibility to do so. For example, by expressing her and Tommy's love to Madame, she inferred the thoughts that she wanted to defer their donation.</p>
    <p>With Ruth donating, Kathy and Tommy became closer from less burden. In caring for Tommy, Kathy was both attentive and considerate, doing what many couples would do for each other. Even though she was unsuccessful in extending Tommy's donation, she did not give up on him and stayed with him until he completed his last donation.</p>
    <p>“He tried to shake me off, but I kept | holding on until stopped shouting and I felt the fight go out of him. Then I realized he too had his arms around me. And so we stood together like that, at the top of that field, for what seemed like ages, not saying anything, just holding each other, while the wind kept blowing and blowing at us, tugging our clothes, and for a moment, it seemed like we were holding onto each other because that was the only way to stop us being swept away into the night.”</p>
    <p>Kathy and Ruth's previous relationship was full of conflict and vitriol, but as the story progresses, the two begin to open up and their relationship mellows with the process. When Ruth is on her deathbed, Kathy not only takes care of her but accompanies her to do things she's always wanted to do, such as going to see the abandoned boat in the marsh.</p>
   <hr>
    <h3>Ruth</h3>
    <p>Ruth, who in earlier stories displayed a strong sense of control and jealousy, changes dramatically as the plot progresses. In the later stages, she begins to explain the reasons for her behavior in the past and becomes more honest. Gradually, she begins to accept his fate and feels guilty about the decisions that potentially damaged other people she had made.</p>
    <p>Tommy and Ruth's relationship has grown flat, having been separated due to the fact that both Kathy and Ruth are donors. On a trip they went together to see the boat, they get closer again through simple gestures and small talk, but the kind of emotion can no longer be seen as the love between a real couple. When Ruth finally confesses, Tommy shows no reaction.</p>
    <p>“She said this still without looking Tommy’s way. But it wasn’t so much like she was ignoring him, than that she was trying so intensely to get through to me everything else had been blurred out.”</p>
    <p>“Tommy shifted again behind us, but Ruth was leaning forward now, looking straight at me, like for the moment Tommy wasn’t with us in the car at all.”</p>
      <hr>
    <h3>Tommy</h3>
    <p>Tommy is always very outspoken, even from the start of this story to the end. For example, he also shows incredulity when he learns the truth about what happened and expresses his resentment and helplessness toward his fate by letting out a cry. Moreover，after learning the truth that he is a clone and is unable to change his fate. He no longer hides his inner turmoil and tends to express his anger and helplessness in a direct, even impulsive manner. He longs to break through the established fate, but the ruthlessness of reality makes his efforts seem especially futile.</p>
      <hr>
<h3>Madame</h3>
<p>Madame, this passage carries a profound meaning that reveals the fate of the clones in the article. During Kathy's conversation with Miss Emily, Miss Emily says that through the clones' paintings, they realized that there is a significant difference between clones and normal people; colons don't have emotions and will never be able to have them like normal people. However, in the end, Madame whispers to them that she could see Kathy possessed real emotions when she watched her listen to the tape and hold the baby that day. It eventually brought tears to her eyes, because she had known at the beginning that the clones were doomed to a fate of mortality with inevitableness. The New World is a more scientific, but also extremely cruel world. Scientists relied on organs from clones for the medical and treatment research that benefitted society while colons began to have real emotions. This situation reflects the complexity of human nature, as well as the profound moral considerations that reveal the brutal nature of the New World's operations.</p>
<hr>

    <h3>Miss Emily</h3>
    <p>Miss Emily is an important character who, at the end of Chapter 3, reveals the real identities of Tommy and Kathy, their mission, and the meaning of their existence. She explains why they ultimately failed. The revelation of these truths not only changes the progression of the story but also profoundly affects the reader's understanding of the entire text.</p>
