        <h2>Setting</h2>
        <p><strong>England, late 1990s:</strong> Never Let Me Go gives us three main institutional settings: Hailsham, the Cottages, and the donor recovery centers. Though Kathy spends most of her time in these three locations, the girl can drive a car, so sometimes she gets to go exploring. She does get to drive through various English towns and fields.</p>
        <p><strong>Hailsham:</strong> Kathy and her friends spend the first sixteen years of their lives at Hailsham. From what Kathy tells us, the digs sound pretty sweet, even if there are some creepy elements. The real estate listing for Hailsham might sound something like this:</p>
        <p>This spacious house contains plenty of classrooms and dorm huts for all your schooling needs. It boasts a large sports pavilion perfect for spying on boys playing in neighboring fields. The ample grounds are surrounded by a fence that is not electrified (but which no one crosses anyways) and creepy woods (where no one goes because they fear they may get dismembered). Entirely secluded from the outside world, this real estate gem is perfect for hiding clones that you want to pretend don't exist. But beware: if you ever leave, you will never ever be able to find Hailsham again.</p>
        <p>It is weird that Kathy can't find the place she grew up. We know she had geography lessons at Hailsham, but apparently they forgot to mention the school's address. Or even what town it's in. This means Kathy sees reminders of her home everywhere, but can't actually track the place down:</p>
        <p>"Driving around the country now, I still see things that will remind me of Hailsham. I might pass the corner of a misty field, or see part of a large house in the distance as I come down the side of a valley, even a particular arrangement of poplar trees up on a hillside. Then I see it's impossible and I go on driving, my thoughts drifting on elsewhere" (1.8).</p>
        <p>Hailsham sure is a hidden gem—emphasis on the hidden.</p>
        <p><strong>Donor Recovery Centers:</strong> The final stop for each of the donors is a recovery center. These are the buildings where Kathy and her friends undergo operations to remove their vital organs, and where they recuperate between donations. They are also the places where the donors "complete."</p>
        <p>Also, what do you make of this term "recovery center"? We're thinking that it's a bit of a euphemism. In fact, you might even call it propaganda to make the centers sound more positive. The truth is that the donors recover just to be cut up again and donate more organs. And eventually, they don't recover at all. But whoever gave these centers their name was a marketing genius.</p>
        <p>"Recovery center" sure does sound less ominous than "completion center" or "place where you give away organs and die."</p>
