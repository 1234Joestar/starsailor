    <h2>Setting</h2>
    <p>Under this seemingly warm school coat, it is a place that can be called a production line. Kathy and her friends have spent countless "beautiful" times here. But the real picture may not be as rosy as Casey describes it. This is a special school, the school is isolated, do not ask the world, inside the "students" from the "birth" here, experienced 16 years before leaving. It is divided into different areas, numerous classrooms where all students can meet their learning needs, and the huge stadium where students can have good physical fitness. In addition, other facilities in the school are also available, different grades have different dormitories, and the pond provides a different style for the monotonous college. The outside of the school is a forest, because there have been rumors of students missing, no students dare to go in, so students have no contact with the outside world.</p>
    <p>In the school, it can be seen that the teachers want to control everything of the students, so that they do not have redundant ideas, only for the future donation to live, but cannot ignore the point is that people's ideas cannot be controlled, they can control the things that students know, they can control the places where students are active, but they cannot control the students, naive and beautiful dreams. In control, there are also intolerant teachers who want to tell the kids the truth, like Mrs. Lucy. But when control goes on for so long, the idea of sacrifice is ingrained in every child, leaving those who want to change helpless. Only interrupt the students as soon as they have a dream, hopefully not to become more desperate later.</p>
    <p>“But Miss Lucy was now moving her gaze over the lot of us. “I know you don’t mean any harm. But there’s just too much talk like this. I hear it all the time, it’s been allowed to go on, and it’s not right.” I could see more drops coming off the gutter and landing on her shoulder, but she didn’t seem to notice. “If no one else will talk to you,” she continued, “then I will. The problem, as I see it, is that you’ve been told and not told. You’ve been told, but none of you really understand, and I dare say, some people are quite happy to leave it that way. But I’m not. If you’re going to have decent lives, then you’ve got to know and know properly. None of you will go to America, none of you will be film stars. And none of you will be working in supermarkets as I heard some of you planned the other day. Your lives are set out for you.</p>
    <p>You’ll become adults, then before you’re old, before you’re even middle-aged, you’ll start to donate your vital organs. That’s what each of you was created to do. You’re not like the actors you watch on your videos, you’re not even like me. You were brought into this world for a purpose, and your futures, all of them, have been decided. So you’re not to talk that way any more. You’ll be leaving Hailsham before long, and it’s not so far off, the day you’ll be preparing for your first donations. You need to remember that. If you’re to have decent lives, you have to know who you are and what lies ahead of you, every one of you.” (Ishiguro 7).</p>
    <p>In the recovery center, I think this should be the calmest but most desperate place for each clone, calm because they have already known and accustomed to such a life, desperate because in any case, watching the death of people around them, thinking of their own future is the same, can not help but feel hopeless. They are divided into two types here, donors and caretakers, donors are undoubtedly clones of donated organs, and caretakers are people who want to keep donors in a good condition. These two types of characters are essentially the same, because they will both eventually die. Donors will experience four donations, and donated organs may not be safe each time, they may also die after a donation, which makes me feel endless cold, those clones, since they were born to be inculcated with the spirit of sacrifice, life is according to the dedication of their own lives, when the completion of the donation, their life or mission is over. No one cares because they're clones.</p>

    <section id="characters">
        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <h4>Kathy H:</h4>
        <p>Kathy is a carer. She spent her childhood going to school and living in Hailsham. Kathy is empathetic, observant, and has a delicate heart. From the beginning of her conversation with Tommy, it is clear that she is constantly aware of his state, such as noticing Tommy's shirt and comforting him when he is being bullied by others.</p>
    <p>She is extremely observant and is able to keenly determine where to communicate with others so as not to be overheard. For example, when discussing Miss Lucy with Tommy by the pond, she chooses a secluded spot and always observes her surroundings, which demonstrates her meticulousness and thoroughness.</p>
    <p>In addition, Kathy has a very precise grasp of the timing of communication and always says the right thing at the right time. She is very sensitive at heart, for example, she is able to detect Ruth's fantastical state of mind when she shows jealousy because she received a beautiful pencil case, and even the urge to insist on revealing other people's secrets despite Ruth's feelings.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, Kathy also realizes her own shortcomings and takes the initiative to try to reconcile with Ruth at a later stage.</p>
    <p>Kathy is the main character in the text who is always trying to understand who she is and for what purpose she exists. Through her, the author reveals who they are and what the purpose of the school is.</p>
        <h4>Ruth:</h4>
    <p>Ruth is an outgoing, outspoken, and highly influential person. Her outspoken nature is especially evident in her conversations with Kathy, where she always expresses her feelings and opinions unabashedly.</p>
    <p>In the dormitory, other students tend to wait for her to express her opinion first before following suit and expressing their own, which fully reflects her authority among her peers. Through the character of Ruth, the author not only sets the scene for the later part of the essay, but also skillfully reveals their special identities, while showing the structure of the school and the complex relationships among classmates.</p>
    <p>A great deal of the text deals with her donation experience, as well as the conflict and eventual reconciliation between her and Kathy.</p>
        <h4>Tommy:</h4>
    <p>Tommy is an emotional person who is susceptible to mood swings and is also very sensual. He excels in sports and displays outstanding athletic ability. However, he is relatively weak in terms of artistic creativity and expression, which often makes him seem overwhelmed when presenting his work.</p>
    <p>The book portrays his characteristics through many important episodes, such as the passion and concentration he shows at the beginning of the soccer match, and his later conversation with Kathy discussing Miss Lucy at the pond in Hailsham. Through his behavior and conversations, the author not only reveals his inner sensitivity and true emotions, but also subtly hints at the special nature of their identity, setting the stage for the subsequent plot.</p>

    <section id="themes">
    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <h4>The Power of Memory</h4>
    <p>Kathy copes with the losses in her life by turning to memories of the past. She preserves the memory of Hailsham long after it has closed, just as she preserves her memories of Tommy and Ruth long after their deaths. The novel’s title epitomizes this desire to hold on. The phrase “never let me go” is somewhere between a plea and a demand, reflecting a deeply human need to hold onto, and be held by, loved ones.</p>
    <p>Kathy’s memories are her way of holding onto everyone and everything she has lost. However, Kathy’s memory is also fragmented and somewhat incomplete. Her narrative is a process of recovery and an attempt to make sense of her memories. She admits to forgetting and misremembering details, showing that memory is just as fragile as it is powerful. Her first-person narration also highlights the absence of other characters’ memories. Ruth and Tommy only appear as reflected through Kathy’s memory, which means that their own thoughts and motivations remain somewhat ambiguous.</p>
    <h4>The Dignity of Human Life</h4>
    <p>Kathy’s narrative is ultimately a testament to the dignity and humanity of the students whom she remembers. The students have less time than their counterparts in the outside world, but their lives are as rich with the hopes, joys, disappointments, and sorrows that define human experience.</p>
    <p>Kathy’s memories also ironize the efforts of Miss Emily and Madame to demonstrate the students’ humanity through their childhood artwork. Despite their good intentions, both Miss Emily and Madame feel revulsion towards the students whose lives they seek to improve. Kathy, meanwhile, shares the memories of her loved ones with quiet dignity and tenderness. Her narrative speaks for itself, showing the depths of her humanity in ways that Madame and Miss Emily are not capable of doing.</p>

<section id="important-moments">
    <h2>Important Moments</h2>
    <p>Never Let Me Go is an important episode in the book, with background on the narrative of Kathy being a carer. The references to Ruth's third and fourth donations and the first donation, as well as Kathy and Tommy's discussion of Miss Lucy around the pond, her view of Tommy's creativity and donation, and the connection between them, are important events in the book.</p>
    <p>Later, a description of Madame, the auction, and the students' work in the gallery are also crucial events. These moments set the scene for the rest of the essay, revealing who the students are and the purpose for which the school was established.</p>
    <p>Additionally, many pronouns are used in the essay to refer to things that the author does not explicitly state. The Ruth donation, the creativity and auction, the gallery, the description of the school's rehabilitation center, and the teachers' concealment of the students' true identities or their unusual attitudes toward them all provide implicit information about who they might be.</p>
