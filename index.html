        <h2>Setting</h2>
        <p><h4>England, late 1990s:</h4></p>
        <p>Never Let Me Go gives us three main institutional settings: Hailsham, the Cottages, and the donor recovery centers. Though Kathy spends most of her time in these three locations, the girl can drive a car, so sometimes she gets to go exploring. She does get to drive through various English towns and fields.</p>
    
        <p><h4>Hailsham:</h4></p>
        <p>Kathy and her friends spend the first sixteen years of their lives at Hailsham. From what Kathy tells us, the digs sound pretty sweet, even if there are some creepy elements. The real estate listing for Hailsham might sound something like this:</p>
        <p>This spacious house contains plenty of classrooms and dorm huts for all your schooling needs. It boasts a large sports pavilion perfect for spying on boys playing in neighboring fields. The ample grounds are surrounded by a fence that is not electrified (but which no one crosses anyways) and creepy woods (where no one goes because they fear they may get dismembered). Entirely secluded from the outside world, this real estate gem is perfect for hiding clones that you want to pretend don't exist. But beware: if you ever leave, you will never ever be able to find Hailsham again.</p>
        <p>It is weird that Kathy can't find the place she grew up. We know she had geography lessons at Hailsham, but apparently they forgot to mention the school's address. Or even what town it's in. This means Kathy sees reminders of her home everywhere, but can't actually track the place down:</p>
        <p>"Driving around the country now, I still see things that will remind me of Hailsham. I might pass the corner of a misty field, or see part of a large house in the distance as I come down the side of a valley, even a particular arrangement of poplar trees up on a hillside. Then I see it's impossible and I go on driving, my thoughts drifting on elsewhere" (1.8).</p>
        <p>Hailsham sure is a hidden gem—emphasis on the hidden.</p>
    
        <p><h4>Donor Recovery Centers:</h4></p>
        <p>The final stop for each of the donors is a recovery center. These are the buildings where Kathy and her friends undergo operations to remove their vital organs, and where they recuperate between donations. They are also the places where the donors "complete."</p>
        <p>Also, what do you make of this term "recovery center"? We're thinking that it's a bit of a euphemism. In fact, you might even call it propaganda to make the centers sound more positive. The truth is that the donors recover just to be cut up again and donate more organs. And eventually, they don't recover at all. But whoever gave these centers their name was a marketing genius.</p>
        <p>"Recovery center" sure does sound less ominous than "completion center" or "place where you give away organs and die."</p>

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <h4>Kathy H:</h4>
        <p>Kathy is a carer. She spent her childhood going to school and living in Hailsham. Kathy is empathetic, observant, and has a delicate heart. From the beginning of her conversation with Tommy, it is clear that she is constantly aware of his state, such as noticing Tommy's shirt and comforting him when he is being bullied by others.</p>
    <p>She is extremely observant and is able to keenly determine where to communicate with others so as not to be overheard. For example, when discussing Miss Lucy with Tommy by the pond, she chooses a secluded spot and always observes her surroundings, which demonstrates her meticulousness and thoroughness.</p>
    <p>In addition, Kathy has a very precise grasp of the timing of communication and always says the right thing at the right time. She is very sensitive at heart, for example, she is able to detect Ruth's fantastical state of mind when she shows jealousy because she received a beautiful pencil case, and even the urge to insist on revealing other people's secrets despite Ruth's feelings.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, Kathy also realizes her own shortcomings and takes the initiative to try to reconcile with Ruth at a later stage.</p>
    <p>Kathy is the main character in the text who is always trying to understand who she is and for what purpose she exists. Through her, the author reveals who they are and what the purpose of the school is.</p>
        <h4>Ruth:</h4>
    <p>Ruth is an outgoing, outspoken, and highly influential person. Her outspoken nature is especially evident in her conversations with Kathy, where she always expresses her feelings and opinions unabashedly.</p>
    <p>In the dormitory, other students tend to wait for her to express her opinion first before following suit and expressing their own, which fully reflects her authority among her peers. Through the character of Ruth, the author not only sets the scene for the later part of the essay, but also skillfully reveals their special identities, while showing the structure of the school and the complex relationships among classmates.</p>
    <p>A great deal of the text deals with her donation experience, as well as the conflict and eventual reconciliation between her and Kathy.</p>
        <h4>Tommy:</h4>
    <p>Tommy is an emotional person who is susceptible to mood swings and is also very sensual. He excels in sports and displays outstanding athletic ability. However, he is relatively weak in terms of artistic creativity and expression, which often makes him seem overwhelmed when presenting his work.</p>
    <p>The book portrays his characteristics through many important episodes, such as the passion and concentration he shows at the beginning of the soccer match, and his later conversation with Kathy discussing Miss Lucy at the pond in Hailsham. Through his behavior and conversations, the author not only reveals his inner sensitivity and true emotions, but also subtly hints at the special nature of their identity, setting the stage for the subsequent plot.</p>

    <section id="themes">
    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <h4>The Power of Memory</h4>
    <p>Kathy copes with the losses in her life by turning to memories of the past. She preserves the memory of Hailsham long after it has closed, just as she preserves her memories of Tommy and Ruth long after their deaths. The novel’s title epitomizes this desire to hold on. The phrase “never let me go” is somewhere between a plea and a demand, reflecting a deeply human need to hold onto, and be held by, loved ones.</p>
    <p>Kathy’s memories are her way of holding onto everyone and everything she has lost. However, Kathy’s memory is also fragmented and somewhat incomplete. Her narrative is a process of recovery and an attempt to make sense of her memories. She admits to forgetting and misremembering details, showing that memory is just as fragile as it is powerful. Her first-person narration also highlights the absence of other characters’ memories. Ruth and Tommy only appear as reflected through Kathy’s memory, which means that their own thoughts and motivations remain somewhat ambiguous.</p>
    <h4>The Dignity of Human Life</h4>
    <p>Kathy’s narrative is ultimately a testament to the dignity and humanity of the students whom she remembers. The students have less time than their counterparts in the outside world, but their lives are as rich with the hopes, joys, disappointments, and sorrows that define human experience.</p>
    <p>Kathy’s memories also ironize the efforts of Miss Emily and Madame to demonstrate the students’ humanity through their childhood artwork. Despite their good intentions, both Miss Emily and Madame feel revulsion towards the students whose lives they seek to improve. Kathy, meanwhile, shares the memories of her loved ones with quiet dignity and tenderness. Her narrative speaks for itself, showing the depths of her humanity in ways that Madame and Miss Emily are not capable of doing.</p>

<section id="important-moments">
    <h2>Important Moments</h2>
    <p>Never Let Me Go is an important episode in the book, with background on the narrative of Kathy being a carer. The references to Ruth's third and fourth donations and the first donation, as well as Kathy and Tommy's discussion of Miss Lucy around the pond, her view of Tommy's creativity and donation, and the connection between them, are important events in the book.</p>
    <p>Later, a description of Madame, the auction, and the students' work in the gallery are also crucial events. These moments set the scene for the rest of the essay, revealing who the students are and the purpose for which the school was established.</p>
    <p>Additionally, many pronouns are used in the essay to refer to things that the author does not explicitly state. The Ruth donation, the creativity and auction, the gallery, the description of the school's rehabilitation center, and the teachers' concealment of the students' true identities or their unusual attitudes toward them all provide implicit information about who they might be.</p>
