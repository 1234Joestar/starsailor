    <h2>Setting</h2>
    <p>Under this seemingly warm school coat, it is a place that can be called a production line. Kathy and her friends have spent countless "beautiful" times here. But the real picture may not be as rosy as Casey describes it. This is a special school, the school is isolated, do not ask the world, inside the "students" from the "birth" here, experienced 16 years before leaving. It is divided into different areas, numerous classrooms where all students can meet their learning needs, and the huge stadium where students can have good physical fitness. In addition, other facilities in the school are also available, different grades have different dormitories, and the pond provides a different style for the monotonous college. The outside of the school is a forest, because there have been rumors of students missing, no students dare to go in, so students have no contact with the outside world.</p>
    <p>In the school, it can be seen that the teachers want to control everything of the students, so that they do not have redundant ideas, only for the future donation to live, but cannot ignore the point is that people's ideas cannot be controlled, they can control the things that students know, they can control the places where students are active, but they cannot control the students, naive and beautiful dreams. In control, there are also intolerant teachers who want to tell the kids the truth, like Mrs. Lucy. But when control goes on for so long, the idea of sacrifice is ingrained in every child, leaving those who want to change helpless. Only interrupt the students as soon as they have a dream, hopefully not to become more desperate later.</p>
    <p>“But Miss Lucy was now moving her gaze over the lot of us. “I know you don’t mean any harm. But there’s just too much talk like this. I hear it all the time, it’s been allowed to go on, and it’s not right.” I could see more drops coming off the gutter and landing on her shoulder, but she didn’t seem to notice. “If no one else will talk to you,” she continued, “then I will. The problem, as I see it, is that you’ve been told and not told. You’ve been told, but none of you really understand, and I dare say, some people are quite happy to leave it that way. But I’m not. If you’re going to have decent lives, then you’ve got to know and know properly. None of you will go to America, none of you will be film stars. And none of you will be working in supermarkets as I heard some of you planned the other day. Your lives are set out for you.</p>
    <p>You’ll become adults, then before you’re old, before you’re even middle-aged, you’ll start to donate your vital organs. That’s what each of you was created to do. You’re not like the actors you watch on your videos, you’re not even like me. You were brought into this world for a purpose, and your futures, all of them, have been decided. So you’re not to talk that way any more. You’ll be leaving Hailsham before long, and it’s not so far off, the day you’ll be preparing for your first donations. You need to remember that. If you’re to have decent lives, you have to know who you are and what lies ahead of you, every one of you.” (Ishiguro 7).</p>
    <p>In the recovery center, I think this should be the calmest but most desperate place for each clone, calm because they have already known and accustomed to such a life, desperate because in any case, watching the death of people around them, thinking of their own future is the same, can not help but feel hopeless. They are divided into two types here, donors and caretakers, donors are undoubtedly clones of donated organs, and caretakers are people who want to keep donors in a good condition. These two types of characters are essentially the same, because they will both eventually die. Donors will experience four donations, and donated organs may not be safe each time, they may also die after a donation, which makes me feel endless cold, those clones, since they were born to be inculcated with the spirit of sacrifice, life is according to the dedication of their own lives, when the completion of the donation, their life or mission is over. No one cares because they're clones.</p>

    <h2>Character</h2>

    <p><h4>Kathy·H:</h4></p>
    <p>Kathy is a carer. She spent her childhood going to school and living in Hailsham. Kathy is empathetic, observant, but sometimes she can be mean.</p>
    <p>From the beginning of her conversation with Tommy, it is clear that she is constantly aware of his state, such as noticing Tommy's shirt and comforting him when he is being bullied by others.</p>
    <p>Quote: “His arms were still flailing about, and he wasn't to know I was about to put out my hand. Anyway, as he threw up his arm, he knocked my hand aside and hit the side of my face. It didn't hurt at all, but I let out a gasp, and so did most of the girls behind me. "Tommy," I said, quite sternly. "There's mud all over your shirt."” (page.10)</p>
    <p>She is extremely observant and is able to keenly determine where to communicate with others so as not to be overheard. For example, when discussing Miss Lucy with Tommy by the pond, she chooses a secluded spot and always observes her surroundings, which demonstrates her meticulousness and thoroughness.</p>
    <p>“For a start you could be clearly seen from the house. And the way the sound travelled across the water was hard to predict; if people wanted to eavesdrop, it was the easiest thing to walk down the outer path and crouch in the bushes on the other side of the pond. But since it had been me that had cut him off in the lunch queue, I supposed I had to make the best of it. It was well into October by then, but the sun was out that day and I decided I could just about make out I’d gone strolling aimlessly down there and happened to come across Tommy.” (page.25)</p>
    <p>In addition, Kathy has a very precise grasp of the timing of communication and always says the right thing at the right time. She is very sensitive at heart, for example, she is able to detect Ruth's fantastical state of mind when she shows jealousy because she received a pencil case, and even the urge to insist on revealing other people's secrets despite Ruth's feelings. And she learns to cheat, using the market's trading records to catch Ruth in the act, but she doesn't realize how much power she has.</p>
    <p>“Now I saw how upset Ruth was; how for once she was at a complete loss for words, and had turned away on the verge of tears. And suddenly my behaviour seemed to me utterly baffling. All this effort, all this planning, just to upset my dearest friend. So what if she'd fibbed a little about her pencil case?” (page. 60)</p>
    <p>Kathy is the main character in the text who is always trying to understand who she is and for what purpose she exists. Through her, the author reveals who they are and what the purpose of the school is.</p>

    <p><h4>Tommy:</h4></p>
    <p>Tommy is an emotional person who is susceptible to mood swings and is also very sensual. He excels in sports and displays outstanding athletic ability. However, he is relatively weak in terms of artistic creativity and expression, which often makes him seem overwhelmed when presenting his work.</p>
    <p>“Anyway, he did his elephant, which was exactly the sort of picture a kid three years younger might have done. It took him no more than twenty minutes and it got a laugh, sure enough, though not quite the sort he'd expected. Even so, it might not have led to anything—and this is a big irony, I suppose if Miss Geraldine” (page 19.)</p>
    <p>The book portrays his characteristics through many important episodes, such as the passion and concentration he shows at the beginning of the soccer match, and his later conversation with Kathy discussing Miss Lucy at the pond in Hailsham. Through his behavior and conversations, the author not only reveals his inner sensitivity and true emotions, but also subtly hints at the special nature of their identity, setting the stage for the subsequent plot.</p>

    <p><h4>Ruth:</h4></p>
    <p>Ruth is outgoing, outspoken, and very controlling and influential. Her outspoken nature is especially evident in her conversations with Kathy, where she always expresses her feelings and opinions unabashedly.</p>
    <p>In the dormitory, other students often have to wait for her to express her opinion first before they will follow suit, which fully reflects her authority among her classmates.</p>
    <p>As well as her founding of Secret Guard, that organization can reflect the author's control through Ruth.</p>
    <p>“I was never sure if Ruth had actually invented the secret guard herself, but there was no doubt she was the leader. There were between six and ten of us, the figure changing whenever Ruth allowed in a new member or expelled someone.” (page 49)</p>
    <p>Her characterization not only sets the stage for the second half of the text, but the author also subtly reveals their special identities while showing the structure of the school and the complex relationships between classmates. A great deal of the text deals with Ruth's experience with donations, as well as the conflict and eventual reconciliation between her and Kathy.</p>

    <p>The relationship between Tommy and Kathy is full of subtle complexities, resembling both love and a very close friendship. Kathy always cares about Tommy and they often discuss many secrets about the school, sharing a deep trust and a unique bond. In contrast, Kathy and Ruth's relationship is full of tension. They are in the same grade and live in the same dormitory, but at times their relationship is permeated with lies and hypocrisy. Their friendship is complicated by a pencil case or a fight over the care of a guardian. The relationship is also strained by their personality differences—Ruth is strong and controlling, especially in the Secret Guard organization, where she is dominant. This gradually drives Kathy away from Ruth. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth is equally delicate. Ruth mocks Tommy from time to time, sometimes even deliberately preventing the relationship between Tommy and Kathy from developing. Despite this, Tommy and Kathy's relationship remains strong, and the bond between them may be love or a deep friendship. When Tommy is in a negative mood, it is only Kathy who can truly comfort him and calm him down again. It is the moments when they share discussions about the meaning of school and who they really are that therefore bring them closer together.</p>

    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <h4>The Power of Memory</h4>
    <p>Kathy copes with the losses in her life by turning to memories of the past. She preserves the memory of Hailsham long after it has closed, just as she preserves her memories of Tommy and Ruth long after their deaths. The novel’s title epitomizes this desire to hold on. The phrase “never let me go” is somewhere between a plea and a demand, reflecting a deeply human need to hold onto, and be held by, loved ones.</p>
    <p>Kathy’s memories are her way of holding onto everyone and everything she has lost. However, Kathy’s memory is also fragmented and somewhat incomplete. Her narrative is a process of recovery and an attempt to make sense of her memories. She admits to forgetting and misremembering details, showing that memory is just as fragile as it is powerful. Her first-person narration also highlights the absence of other characters’ memories. Ruth and Tommy only appear as reflected through Kathy’s memory, which means that their own thoughts and motivations remain somewhat ambiguous.</p>
    <h4>The Dignity of Human Life</h4>
    <p>Kathy’s narrative is ultimately a testament to the dignity and humanity of the students whom she remembers. The students have less time than their counterparts in the outside world, but their lives are as rich with the hopes, joys, disappointments, and sorrows that define human experience.</p>
    <p>Kathy’s memories also ironize the efforts of Miss Emily and Madame to demonstrate the students’ humanity through their childhood artwork. Despite their good intentions, both Miss Emily and Madame feel revulsion towards the students whose lives they seek to improve. Kathy, meanwhile, shares the memories of her loved ones with quiet dignity and tenderness. Her narrative speaks for itself, showing the depths of her humanity in ways that Madame and Miss Emily are not capable of doing.</p>

    <h2>Important Events</h2>

    <p>In the novel *Never Let Me Go*, there are a number of key plot points that reveal the development of subsequent episodes, such as those concerning Kathy's background as a carer and the process of Ruth's donations—both the first one when she was a young woman and the subsequent third and fourth ones. Also, a major key plot point is the incident where Kathy and Tommy discuss Miss Lucy by the pond, mentioning her opinion of Tommy's creativity. The identities of later important characters—Madame, the meaning behind the gallery and auction, and the rumors of the forest around the school—have deep metaphors running through them.</p>
    <p>First and foremost mentioned in the book is the fact that there are donations about Ruth. In the book, Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth are all students at the same Hailsham School. The author implies that their fate has long been sealed and they need to take on the task of donating. The conversation between Kathy and Tommy by the pond is particularly important. The pond is man-made and segregated, perhaps symbolizing their own “artificial” nature and social isolation. By analyzing the significance of Miss Lucy's words, they make a strong connection between creativity, painting, and donation, suggesting a purpose and meaning behind these actions.</p>
    <p>Secondly, the first visit to Mrs. Madeleine is impressive in terms of the fear she shows towards the students. She compares them to spiders, an analogy that suggests that they are not really “human” and that the author seems to be hinting at who they are. In addition, the legend of the mysterious forest surrounding the school and the students' inability to explain the origin of these memories may be a metaphor for their memories being carefully fabricated with a clear purpose behind them.</p>
    <p>There are also references to key items in the book, such as those of Kathy and Ruth. They keep the events of the key items secret from each other. Ruth's pencil case, even though it is not valuable, provokes interest and jealousy among the students, perhaps suggesting that they are different from ordinary children. And in the description of Kathy's tape, especially Kathy's action of hugging the child while listening to the tape, not only shows her distinctive emotional turmoil. From Mrs. Madeline's reaction, it can be seen that Kathy may have some special qualities and possess emotions that she should not have. It also seems to hint at her later destiny and may also set the stage for her later becoming a carer and not needing to be immediately involved in donations.</p>
