      <h3>Intricate relationship</h3>
<p>In the third part, the relationship seems to become particularly important, both love and friendship seem to face challenges. After becoming a carer, although our protagonist Kathy tells us that she can adapt to such a life, it can be seen from other people's reactions that it is not an easy thing to be a carer or a donor. Kathy's former friend Laura, She was originally happy and humorous, but now she has been devastated and can't say a joke, just numb to talk with Kathy, which undoubtedly shows us the most sad scene about the fate of the clone, the original two parts may still exist more life and daily life, and the third part has completely become like mechanization. With endless work comes the possibility of death at any moment. Even more so in love, although Kathy is still working as a carer, her two friends Ruth and Tommy have begun to donate, which undoubtedly makes their health worse. After Kathy takes Ruth and Tommy to the boat journey, Ruth has a great change, Ruth originally did not want to let Kathy and Tommy together. Although her relationship with Tommy was no longer so close, on the way back, Ruth sincerely apologized to Kathy and persuaded her to stay with Tommy so that they might have a chance to apply for an extension.</p>
<p>From now on, it can also be seen that the relationship between Ruth, Kathy and Tommy has also changed, because Ruth's perfection, but also let Kathy and Tommy spent a period of time can be called happy, but this period of time is still short, after experiencing the conversation with Mrs. And Miss Emily, the only hope is also shattered, followed by Tommy's donation. Tommy, not wanting Kathy to be sad about his departure, volunteered to change care, and Tommy's departure soon after marked the end of Kathy's love. Throughout the book, love is not an obvious theme, after all, Kathy's personal description, but we can still see Kathy's love for Tommy, Tommy is the only person who can understand Kathy and discuss those special ideas with Kathy, so Kathy has always had special feelings for Tommy, but it is just because of Ruth's sake that she can't show it. Although this last period of time gave Kathy a chance, but fleeting, no doubt more highlighted the tragic fate of the clone.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Lost</h3>
<p>In the third part, I think from Kathy's perspective, which is the perspective of this book, there is no doubt that it is a process of loss. She has lost her friends, her lover, the place where she once studied and had memories, and lost her hope and everything, which represents the coming of the end. The third part no longer tells the details of life like the first two parts. On the contrary, she told us the whole picture of the world and wanted to express the hidden meaning through several things. After becoming a caretaker, because of the special nature of Kathy herself, she could still do the carer work easily compared with others, but others could not. Whether it was a caretaker or a donor, it was painful and tiring for the clone, after all, I did not know when. After a donation, there is a possibility of death. And Kathy's friends, Tommy and Ruth, after losing Ruth, Kathy and Tommy originally thought that they could try to extension, so as to stay together for a while, but when they really learned from the madam and Miss Emily about the current situation, the last hope is gone, waiting for their ending has been doomed. Just like they've always been told. In this way, after Tommy's donation, Ruth lost everything and was left alone.</p>
