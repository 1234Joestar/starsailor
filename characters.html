    <h3>Kathy</h3>
<p>Kathy has a very delicate mind and she is very capable of putting herself in someone else's shoes. This is very obvious. When the clones went to live in the cottage, she had a lot of problems with Ruth and felt that she was becoming less and less like the Ruth she used to be, but Kathy was able to calmly analyze the reasons, put herself in her shoes, and then forgave her over and over again. Again, she is very eager to be loved, even when she knows that Tommy and Ruth are a couple. While in Norfolk, she and Tommy go on a tape hunt together, and in the process, she really enjoys the time they both spend together. In the description of the story, they were more like a couple. Even when they find the tape, they are lost because they can no longer enjoy finding things together.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Ruth</h3>
<p>Ruth is very possessive of Tommy, even though in the text she doesn't really have very good feelings for him. She doesn't care about Tommy's condition from time to time, or is often cold and mocking him. And Ruth is also very vindictive, when Kathy does something that makes her uncomfortable, she will get back at her in another way, by making her suffer from coldness, making her realize her mistake and be difficult. And in this way she shows her superiority.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Tommy</h3>
<p>Tommy's ability to think is so strong that he can constantly remember what Miss Lucy said and always wonder what it really means. He even keeps a mopey state in his life in order to think about these things. At the same time, he is also very concerned about himself as well as very eager to postpone the donation because of his lack of creativity, and he is always thinking of ways to deal with.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Miss Lucy</h3>
<p>She is a Hailsham guardian, but is different compared to other guardians. She is more inclined to tell the clones the facts and believes that the clones have a right to know the whole story of what they are and the donations and so on. For example, in her conversation with Tommy, she reassures him that creativity doesn't matter because she understands and sympathizes with Tommy so much, which goes against what the school wants. In a later scene where there is a downpour, she also can't stand this system at the school and argues against the children's belief that they can have a free future on their own. She reveals to the children that their future is all planned out. In the end she leaves Hailsham.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chrissie and Rodney</h3>
<p>Chrissie and Rodney are clones from non-Hailsham schools. They are a class or two older than the clones from Hailsham. And Chrissie and Rodney are very interested in rumors. They have a lot of rumors and often tell them to Ruth. They were able to bring a lot of information outside of Hailsham School to Ruth, Tommy and Kathy. Like the fact that if the two were truly in love they would have a three-year period of their own to avoid donations. That message is what they told Kathy about them. While at cottages they were also very curious about the students at Hailsham.</p>
