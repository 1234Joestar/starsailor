      <h4>Kathy.H:</h4>
      <p>Kathy is a carer. She spent her childhood going to school and living in Hailsham. Kathy is empathetic, observant, but sometimes she can be mean.</p>
      <p>From the beginning of her conversation with Tommy, it is clear that she is constantly aware of his state, such as noticing Tommy's shirt and comforting him when he is being bullied by others.</p>
      <p>Quote: “His arms were still flailing about, and he wasn't to know I was about to put out my hand. Anyway, as he threw up his arm, he knocked my hand aside and hit the side of my face. It didn't hurt at all, but I let out a gasp, and so did most of the girls behind me. "Tommy," I said, quite sternly. "There's mud all over your shirt."” (page.10)</p>
      <p>She is extremely observant and is able to keenly determine where to communicate with others so as not to be overheard. For example, when discussing Miss Lucy with Tommy by the pond, she chooses a secluded spot and always observes her surroundings, which demonstrates her meticulousness and thoroughness.</p>
      <p>“For a start you could be clearly seen from the house. And the way the sound travelled across the water was hard to predict; if people wanted to eavesdrop, it was the easiest thing to walk down the outer path and crouch in the bushes on the other side of the pond. But since it had been me that had cut him off in the lunch queue, I supposed I had to make the best of it. It was well into October by then, but the sun was out that day and I decided I could just about make out I’d gone strolling aimlessly down there and happened to come across Tommy.” (page.25)</p>
      <p>In addition, Kathy has a very precise grasp of the timing of communication and always says the right thing at the right time. She is very sensitive at heart, for example, she is able to detect Ruth's fantastical state of mind when she shows jealousy because she received a pencil case, and even the urge to insist on revealing other people's secrets despite Ruth's feelings. And she learns to cheat, using the market's trading records to catch Ruth in the act, but she doesn't realize how much power she has.</p>
      <p>“Now I saw how upset Ruth was; how for once she was at a complete loss for words, and had turned away on the verge of tears. And suddenly my behaviour seemed to me utterly baffling. All this effort, all this planning, just to upset my dearest friend. So what if she'd fibbed a little about her pencil case?” (page. 60)</p>
      <p>Kathy is the main character in the text who is always trying to understand who she is and for what purpose she exists. Through her, the author reveals who they are and what the purpose of the school is.</p>

      <h4>Tommy:</h4>
      <p>Tommy is an emotional person who is susceptible to mood swings and is also very sensual. He excels in sports and displays outstanding athletic ability. However, he is relatively weak in terms of artistic creativity and expression, which often makes him seem overwhelmed when presenting his work.</p>
      <p>“Anyway, he did his elephant, which was exactly the sort of picture a kid three years younger might have done. It took him no more than twenty minutes and it got a laugh, sure enough, though not quite the sort he'd expected. Even so, it might not have led to anything—and this is a big irony, I suppose if Miss Geraldine” (page 19.)</p>
      <p>The book portrays his characteristics through many important episodes, such as the passion and concentration he shows at the beginning of the soccer match, and his later conversation with Kathy discussing Miss Lucy at the pond in Hailsham. Through his behavior and conversations, the author not only reveals his inner sensitivity and true emotions, but also subtly hints at the special nature of their identity, setting the stage for the subsequent plot.</p>

      <h4>Ruth:</h4>
      <p>Ruth is outgoing, outspoken, and very controlling and influential. Her outspoken nature is especially evident in her conversations with Kathy, where she always expresses her feelings and opinions unabashedly.</p>
      <p>In the dormitory, other students often have to wait for her to express her opinion first before they wil
