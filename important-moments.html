    <p>In the novel *Never Let Me Go*, there are a number of key plot points that reveal the development of subsequent episodes, such as those concerning Kathy's background as a carer and the process of Ruth's donations—both the first one when she was a young woman and the subsequent third and fourth ones. Also, a major key plot point is the incident where Kathy and Tommy discuss Miss Lucy by the pond, mentioning her opinion of Tommy's creativity. The identities of later important characters—Madame, the meaning behind the gallery and auction, and the rumors of the forest around the school—have deep metaphors running through them.</p>
    <p>First and foremost mentioned in the book is the fact that there are donations about Ruth. In the book, Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth are all students at the same Hailsham School. The author implies that their fate has long been sealed and they need to take on the task of donating. The conversation between Kathy and Tommy by the pond is particularly important. The pond is man-made and segregated, perhaps symbolizing their own “artificial” nature and social isolation. By analyzing the significance of Miss Lucy's words, they make a strong connection between creativity, painting, and donation, suggesting a purpose and meaning behind these actions.</p>
    <p>Secondly, the first visit to Madame is impressive in terms of the fear she shows towards the students. She compares them to spiders, an analogy that suggests that they are not really “human” and that the author seems to be hinting at who they are. In addition, the legend of the mysterious forest surrounding the school and the students' inability to explain the origin of these memories may be a metaphor for their memories being carefully fabricated with a clear purpose behind them.</p>
    <p>There are also references to key items in the book, such as those of Kathy and Ruth. They keep the events of the key items secret from each other. Ruth's pencil case, even though it is not valuable, provokes interest and jealousy among the students, perhaps suggesting that they are different from ordinary children. And in the description of Kathy's tape, especially Kathy's action of hugging the child while listening to the tape, not only shows her distinctive emotional turmoil. From Madame's reaction, it can be seen that Kathy may have some special qualities and possess emotions that she should not have. It also seems to hint at her later destiny and may also set the stage for her later becoming a carer and not needing to be immediately involved in donations.</p>
