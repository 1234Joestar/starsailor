<h3>The Importance of Donations and Predetermined Fate</h3>
<p>In the novel <em>Never Let Me Go</em>, there are a number of key plot points that reveal the development of subsequent episodes, such as those concerning Kathy's background as a carer and the process of Ruth's donations—both the first one when she was a young woman and the subsequent third and fourth ones. Also, a major key plot point is the incident where Kathy and Tommy discuss Miss Lucy by the pond, mentioning her opinion of Tommy's creativity. The identities of later important characters—Madame, the meaning behind the gallery and auction, and the rumors of the forest around the school—have deep metaphors running through them.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>The Pond and the Symbolism of Miss Lucy's Words</h3>
<p>First and foremost mentioned in the book is the fact that there are donations about Ruth. In the book, Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth are all students at the same Hailsham School. The author implies that their fate has long been sealed and they need to take on the task of donating. The conversation between Kathy and Tommy by the pond is particularly important. The pond is man-made and segregated, perhaps symbolizing their own “artificial” nature and social isolation. By analyzing the significance of Miss Lucy's words, they make a strong connection between creativity, painting, and donation, suggesting a purpose and meaning behind these actions.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Madame's Fear and the Spider Analogy</h3>
<p>Secondly, the first visit to Madame is impressive in terms of the fear she shows towards the students. She compares them to spiders, an analogy that suggests that they are not really “human” and that the author seems to be hinting at who they are. In addition, the legend of the mysterious forest surrounding the school and the students' inability to explain the origin of these memories may be a metaphor for their memories being carefully fabricated with a clear purpose behind them.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Ruth's Pencil Case and Kathy's Tape</h3>
<p>There are also references to key items in the book, such as those of Kathy and Ruth. They keep the events of the key items secret from each other. Ruth's pencil case, even though it is not valuable, provokes interest and jealousy among the students, perhaps suggesting that they are different from ordinary children. And in the description of Kathy's tape, especially Kathy's action of hugging the child while listening to the tape, not only shows her distinctive emotional turmoil. From Madame's reaction, it can be seen that Kathy may have some special qualities and possess emotions that she should not have. It also seems to hint at her later destiny and may also set the stage for her later becoming a carer and not needing to be immediately involved in donations.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>The Search for the "Originals" in Norfolk</h3>
<p>The fact that Tommy, Ruth, Kathy, Chrissie and Rodney go to Norfolk to find the “original” is very important in this book. It is important in this book because it is a way for them to recognize the lives of their archetypes and their origins. This is very important for them to find themselves and their values. The way they go about finding the original is also a way for them to kind of long for a normal identity, and they want to get rid of this notion that they're just replicas. But in the end, they don't find it. And in the process, Ruth can't accept this reality and reveals what the others have always known but didn't want to admit. They are replicas of some of the lower classes of society, probably some thieves, criminals, prostitutes, etc. and they were created to donate. This is very important in the text because it not only shows the reader what is going on inside their minds, but also their attitude towards their identity.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Tommy and Kathy's Bond During the Tape Hunt</h3>
<p>The incident of Tommy and Kathy looking for the tape in Norfolk is also very important because it is an event that brings them back together before their relationship is heading towards an eventual breakup. In the text this represents the ongoing closeness between the two of them. This behavior is more than just finding an item, this tape is like an experience of which good memories they have in Hailsham. Since they have been in the cottages their personalities have all changed drastically, Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth have a very bad relationship. Looking for the tapes is more like they are trying to find their old close relationships. This can be seen in the description of the text, when Kathy finds the tape she doesn't feel happy, instead she feels very lost and actually tries to enjoy the process of them finding something again by hiding the tape.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Life at the Cottage and Its Transformative Role</h3>
<p>Life at the Cottage is a pivotal event as it is not only the first place the students go as a group after graduating from Hailsham. It is also the place where the relationship between Tommy, Ruth and Kathy is transformed. Unlike Hailsham, this place is relatively free. They can discuss anything. A lot of the text is about sex. This contrasts with Hailsham's attitude towards sex at school. By describing their lives in this place the author wants to show the reader that they have some desires that are no different from normal people and that these clones want to try and be like normal people. This is also verified by the way Ruth learns to clap her hands in the TV set and she imitates some of the behaviors of what she sees as normal people. And here they also meet Chrissie and Rodney, which introduces the main characters and sets the stage for what follows.</p>
