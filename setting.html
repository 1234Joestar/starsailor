      <h4>Hailsham</h4>
      <p>Under this seemingly warm school coat, it is a place that can be called a production line. Kathy and her friends have spent countless "beautiful" times here. But the real picture may not be as rosy as Kathy describes it. This is a special school, the school is isolated, do not ask the world, inside the "students" from the "birth" here, experienced 16 years before leaving. It is divided into different areas, numerous classrooms where all students can meet their learning needs, and the huge stadium where students can have good physical fitness. In addition, other facilities in the school are also available, different grades have different dormitories, and the pond provides a different style for the monotonous college. The outside of the school is a forest, because there have been rumors of students missing, no students dare to go in, so students have no contact with the outside world.</p>
      <p>In the school, it can be seen that the teachers want to control everything of the students, so that they do not have redundant ideas, only for the future donation to live, but cannot ignore the point is that people's ideas cannot be controlled, they can control the things that students know, they can control the places where students are active, but they cannot control the students, naive and beautiful dreams. In control, there are also intolerant teachers who want to tell the kids the truth, like Miss Lucy. But when control goes on for so long, the idea of sacrifice is ingrained in every child, leaving those who want to change helpless. Only interrupt the students as soon as they have a dream, hopefully not to become more desperate later.</p>
      <p>“But Miss Lucy was now moving her gaze over the lot of us. “I know you don’t mean any harm. But there’s just too much talk like this. I hear it all the time, it’s been allowed to go on, and it’s not right.” I could see more drops coming off the gutter and landing on her shoulder, but she didn’t seem to notice. “If no one else will talk to you,” she continued, “then I will. The problem, as I see it, is that you’ve been told and not told. You’ve been told, but none of you really understand, and I dare say, some people are quite happy to leave it that way. But I’m not. If you’re going to have decent lives, then you’ve got to know and know properly. None of you will go to America, none of you will be film stars. And none of you will be working in supermarkets as I heard some of you planned the other day. Your lives are set out for you.</p>
      <p>You’ll become adults, then before you’re old, before you’re even middle-aged, you’ll start to donate your vital organs. That’s what each of you was created to do. You’re not like the actors you watch on your videos, you’re not even like me. You were brought into this world for a purpose, and your futures, all of them, have been decided. So you’re not to talk that way any more. You’ll be leaving Hailsham before long, and it’s not so far off, the day you’ll be preparing for your first donations. You need to remember that. If you’re to have decent lives, you have to know who you are and what lies ahead of you, every one of you.” (Ishiguro 7).</p>
      <p>In the recovery center, I think this should be the calmest but most desperate place for each clone, calm because they have already known and accustomed to such a life, desperate because in any case, watching the death of people around them, thinking of their own future is the same, can not help but feel hopeless. They are divided into two types here, donors and caretakers, donors are undoubtedly clones of donated organs, and caretakers are people who want to keep donors in a good condition. These two types of characters are essentially the same, because they will both eventually die. Donors will experience four donations, and donated organs may not be safe each time, they may also die after a donation, which makes me feel endless cold, those clones, since they were born to be inculcated with the spirit of sacrifice, life is according to the dedication of their own lives, when the completion of the donation, their life or mission is over. No one cares because they're clones.</p>
      <h4>Cottages</h4>
<p>The cottage is the second real place where Kathy and her companions come and live in addition to Hailsham, which is not like the style of Hailsham school, but more like a farm, and they no longer have guardians. Here they meet more seniors, and as time goes by, they gradually realize that the habits and lifestyle here are somewhat different from that of Hailsham. Among these differences, the habits of the older students are a big part, which also leads to some of Kathy's former classmates gradually becoming alienated and wanting to join the "system" of the cottage. The cottage is also the first stop where they will begin to care, and when they graduate from the cottage, they will face training to become carers.</p>  

<h4>Churchyard</h4>
<p>In the Churchyard, the conversation between Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth is probably one of the main reasons for Kathy to choose to leave. The Churchyard is not only a random place, which should be a place for burying the dead, but also seems to temporarily bury the friendship between Kathy and the three of them.</p>  

<h4>Themes: Friendships</h4>
<p>I think by far the biggest theme is friendship, whether it is Kathy's disapproval of Ruth's behavior or her heart-to-heart with Tommy, it is a symbol of friendship. Since arriving at the cottage, the relationship between Kathy and Ruth has become more fragile because Ruth has always wanted to make friends with the senior upperclassmen and even pretended not to know the memories of Hailsham, which completely angered Kathy. This led to a lot of arguments between them. On the other hand, Ruth seemed to be a trusted friend who would stand up for you when you needed help and also mentor you when you were in trouble. But it wasn't until an argument when Ruth attacked Kathy with a secret that Kathy had told her that she realized she couldn't talk about everything with Ruth anymore. Although they remained friends for some time, there was a rift.</p>  

<p>But the opposite is the feelings of Kathy and Tommy. When they go to find Ruth's original character, because of Ruth's various behaviors and words, Kathy does not want to continue to act together with Ruth, but Tommy takes the initiative to work with Kathy. During this time, they find the record that Kathy had lost. Tommy also shares his thoughts with Kathy about what Miss Lucy meant by what she said to him earlier and shows the animal he was drawing, while Kathy also tells Tommy that she has always wanted to have sex with someone else. After their heart-to-heart, their relationship is further enhanced. Kathy and Tommy find the record together and don't tell Ruth, but Ruth finds out and forces Tommy to tell her his secret.</p>  

<p>After they gather in the cemetery, Ruth taunts Tommy and says that his animals are a joke, and Kathy thinks so. Kathy wanted to say something to comfort Tommy, but because of Ruth, she didn't say anything, which also caused Tommy to be very disappointed. After this, Kathy wants to find someone who almost makes it clear to Ruth, and Ruth apologizes and says that she might break up with Tommy, but also that Tommy doesn't like girls who have boyfriends, undoubtedly telling Kathy that even if Tommy adores you, you are not possible. Later in the conversation, Ruth begins to recognize Hailsham's previous appearance, which causes Kathy to be speechless. After this, Kathy made up her mind to start nursing training, and the friendship of the three of them ended.</p>
