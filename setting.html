      <h3>Hailsham</h3>
      <p>Under this seemingly warm school coat, it is a place that can be called a production line. Kathy and her friends have spent countless "beautiful" times here. But the real picture may not be as rosy as Kathy describes it. This is a special school, the school is isolated, do not ask the world, inside the "students" from the "birth" here, experienced 16 years before leaving. It is divided into different areas, numerous classrooms where all students can meet their learning needs, and the huge stadium where students can have good physical fitness. In addition, other facilities in the school are also available, different grades have different dormitories, and the pond provides a different style for the monotonous college. The outside of the school is a forest, because there have been rumors of students missing, no students dare to go in, so students have no contact with the outside world.</p>
      <p>In the school, it can be seen that the teachers want to control everything of the students, so that they do not have redundant ideas, only for the future donation to live, but cannot ignore the point is that people's ideas cannot be controlled, they can control the things that students know, they can control the places where students are active, but they cannot control the students, naive and beautiful dreams. In control, there are also intolerant teachers who want to tell the kids the truth, like Miss Lucy. But when control goes on for so long, the idea of sacrifice is ingrained in every child, leaving those who want to change helpless. Only interrupt the students as soon as they have a dream, hopefully not to become more desperate later.</p>
     <hr>
      <h3>Cottages</h3>
<p>The cottage is the second real place where Kathy and her companions come and live in addition to Hailsham, which is not like the style of Hailsham school, but more like a farm, and they no longer have guardians. Here they meet more seniors, and as time goes by, they gradually realize that the habits and lifestyle here are somewhat different from that of Hailsham. Among these differences, the habits of the older students are a big part, which also leads to some of Kathy's former classmates gradually becoming alienated and wanting to join the "system" of the cottage. The cottage is also the first stop where they will begin to care, and when they graduate from the cottage, they will face training to become carers.</p>  
<hr>
<h3>Churchyard</h3>
<p>In the Churchyard, the conversation between Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth is probably one of the main reasons for Kathy to choose to leave. The Churchyard is not only a random place, which should be a place for burying the dead, but also seems to temporarily bury the friendship between Kathy and the three of them.</p>
