      <h4>Hailsham</h4>
      <p>Under this seemingly warm school coat, it is a place that can be called a production line. Kathy and her friends have spent countless "beautiful" times here. But the real picture may not be as rosy as Kathy describes it. This is a special school, the school is isolated, do not ask the world, inside the "students" from the "birth" here, experienced 16 years before leaving. It is divided into different areas, numerous classrooms where all students can meet their learning needs, and the huge stadium where students can have good physical fitness. In addition, other facilities in the school are also available, different grades have different dormitories, and the pond provides a different style for the monotonous college. The outside of the school is a forest, because there have been rumors of students missing, no students dare to go in, so students have no contact with the outside world.</p>
      <p>In the school, it can be seen that the teachers want to control everything of the students, so that they do not have redundant ideas, only for the future donation to live, but cannot ignore the point is that people's ideas cannot be controlled, they can control the things that students know, they can control the places where students are active, but they cannot control the students, naive and beautiful dreams. In control, there are also intolerant teachers who want to tell the kids the truth, like Miss Lucy. But when control goes on for so long, the idea of sacrifice is ingrained in every child, leaving those who want to change helpless. Only interrupt the students as soon as they have a dream, hopefully not to become more desperate later.</p>
      <p>“But Miss Lucy was now moving her gaze over the lot of us. “I know you don’t mean any harm. But there’s just too much talk like this. I hear it all the time, it’s been allowed to go on, and it’s not right.” I could see more drops coming off the gutter and landing on her shoulder, but she didn’t seem to notice. “If no one else will talk to you,” she continued, “then I will. The problem, as I see it, is that you’ve been told and not told. You’ve been told, but none of you really understand, and I dare say, some people are quite happy to leave it that way. But I’m not. If you’re going to have decent lives, then you’ve got to know and know properly. None of you will go to America, none of you will be film stars. And none of you will be working in supermarkets as I heard some of you planned the other day. Your lives are set out for you.</p>
      <p>You’ll become adults, then before you’re old, before you’re even middle-aged, you’ll start to donate your vital organs. That’s what each of you was created to do. You’re not like the actors you watch on your videos, you’re not even like me. You were brought into this world for a purpose, and your futures, all of them, have been decided. So you’re not to talk that way any more. You’ll be leaving Hailsham before long, and it’s not so far off, the day you’ll be preparing for your first donations. You need to remember that. If you’re to have decent lives, you have to know who you are and what lies ahead of you, every one of you.” (Ishiguro 7).</p>
      <p>In the recovery center, I think this should be the calmest but most desperate place for each clone, calm because they have already known and accustomed to such a life, desperate because in any case, watching the death of people around them, thinking of their own future is the same, can not help but feel hopeless. They are divided into two types here, donors and caretakers, donors are undoubtedly clones of donated organs, and caretakers are people who want to keep donors in a good condition. These two types of characters are essentially the same, because they will both eventually die. Donors will experience four donations, and donated organs may not be safe each time, they may also die after a donation, which makes me feel endless cold, those clones, since they were born to be inculcated with the spirit of sacrifice, life is according to the dedication of their own lives, when the completion of the donation, their life or mission is over. No one cares because they're clones.</p>
